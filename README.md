# AI-Practical-assignement

In this README, we will describe how to work on our project.

## Get the repository on your computer
If you are on a Windows machine, I highly suggest that you download GitHub Desktop : https://desktop.github.com/ 
It will help you a lot collaborating on the project and seeing the changes.

Sign in with GitHub. Then, you can clone the project repository by :
- clicking the big green button "Code" on the main page of AI-Practical-assignement and click "Open with GitHub Desktop"
- go on GitHub Desktop and select "Clone a repository from the Internet" and select this one

## Making changes
Before making any changes, remember to fetch any changes made to your local machine by pressing "Fetch origin" (GitHub Desktop will tell you about that I think).

On top of the software screen, click on "Current branch" and select "origin/develop". You are now editing changes on the **develop** branch.

**Make sure you agree with others on which part of the project you are working on.**

Do your changes on code, adding or deleting files.

When you finish, commit your changes to **develop** by commiting using the space at the bottom left of the software screen.
Then, push your work to GitHub.

## Updating changes
It's important that everytime you go on GitHub Desktop, you remember to fetch any changes made to the branch. This way, you can start doing changes without conflict.

(I think it's "Fetch origin" or "Pulling origin")
